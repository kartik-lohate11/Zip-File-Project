# Huffman Coding File Compression and Decompression

## Overview

This Java desktop application implements Huffman coding, a widely-used algorithm for lossless data compression. The project offers functionality to compress and decompress text files efficiently, utilizing the principles of Huffman coding. Developed using Java Swing and AWT, it provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

## Features

- **Huffman Coding**: Implements the Huffman coding algorithm to achieve efficient compression of text files.
- **Compression**: Allows users to compress text files to reduce their size while preserving their content.
- **Decompression**: Provides the ability to decompress previously compressed text files, restoring them to their original state.
- **User Interface**: Utilizes Java Swing and AWT to create an intuitive desktop application interface, ensuring ease of use for all users.
- **Customization**: Offers options for customization, allowing users to choose compression settings and specify output locations.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance, ensuring fast compression and decompression operations even for large text files.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Compatible with multiple operating systems, thanks to its Java-based implementation.

## Usage

1. **Compression**:
    - Select the text file you wish to compress.
    - Choose compression settings if applicable.
    - Click on the "Compress" button to initiate the compression process.
    - The compressed file will be generated in the specified output location.

2. **Decompression**:
    - Select the compressed file you want to decompress.
    - Specify the output location for the decompressed file.
    - Click on the "Decompress" button to start the decompression process.
    - The original text file will be restored in the specified output location.
